# MajoranaPropagation.jl
A Julia library for Majorana propagation simulation of fermionic quantum circuits and quantum systems.

## Usage
The library is currently in "experimental" mode. Adventures are possible, and the first stable release might bring a lot of updates. To use the library, clone the repository and include the source files in your Julia project by running:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate("path/to/project")
Pkg.develop(path="path/to/MajoranaPropagation.jl")
```
afterward, include

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate("path/to/project")

using MajoranaPropagation
using PauliPropagation
```
in the script where you want to use Majorana Propagation's functionalities.

## Majorana Propagation
The code was developed with the goal of simulating the dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model, and the results for large 2D simulations are presented here: [Majorana string simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics in two-dimensional lattice fermion systems](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2511.02809).

## Examples 
You can find example scripts in the `examples/` directory of the repository. We currently illustrate the usage for simulating the evolution of observables under the unitary dynamics generated by the Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian in 1D and 2D lattices.
